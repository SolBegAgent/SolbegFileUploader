Introduction
============

Each context has a temp storage that is used for storing temporary files.
It is files that was saved between requests, but has not been attached to any model yet.
Files in temp storage will be removed by garbage collector automatically by a timeout.

Configure Collector
-------------------

To configure garbage collector you may change `garbage_collector` setting of a context.

The full list of available settings and its defaults you may see below:

```php
// ...
'garbage_collector' => [
    // The name of collector class.
    'class' => \Bicycle\FilesManager\Context\GarbageCollector::class,
    // Time in seconds after which a file will be considered as old.
    'lifetime' => 24 * 60 * 60, // 1 day by default
],
// ...
```

Configure Automated Cleaning
----------------------------

By default contexts are configured so garbage will be collected and cleaned
automatically with 1% chance.

To configure this behavior see the following context's settings:

```php
/**
 * The `gc_probability` in conjunction with `gc_divisor`` is used to manage probability
 * that the garbage collection routine is automatically started.
 * See `gc_divisor` property for details.
 */
 'gc_probability' => 1,

/**
 * The `gc_divisor` coupled with `gc_probability` defines the probability
 * that the garbage collection process is started on every storage initialization.
 * 
 * The probability is calculated by using `gc_probability/gc_divisor`,
 * e.g. 1/100 (default) means there is a 1% chance that the GC process starts on each request.
 */
 'gc_divisor' => 100,
```

To disable auto-cleaning, you may set any of this properties to `0`.

Console Clear Command
=====================

You may use artisan console command to clear old temporary files.

You even may disable automated garbage collector and clear your files
through console command by CRON.

To clear files use the following command:

```
$ php artisan filecontext:clear-garbage
```

You may specify lifetime (in seconds), that would be used to calculate,
whether a file is old or not:

```
$ php artisan filecontext:clear-garbage --lifetime=86400
```

By default lifetime from garbage collector will be used, which default value is 1 day.

You also may check which files will be deleted (without immediate removal):

```
$ php artisan filecontext:clear-garbage --pretend
```

You may specify contexts, that should be cleared:

```
$ php artisan filecontext:clear-garbage --context=user-avatar --context="App\Models\User@inline_photo"
$ php artisan filecontext:clear-garbage -cuser-avatar -c"App\Models\User@inline_photo"
```

By default all contexts from your application config will be cleared.
But if you use inline model defining, you may be don't want
to specify here all contexts each time.
For this you may change `console_clean_contexts` setting in your `config/filemanager.php` config file:

```php
// Examples:
'console_clean_contexts' => [
    'user-avatar',
    'App\Models\SomeModelClass@logo',
],
```
