Introduction
============

Sometimes there may be situations when any file was not found,
and context cannot generate url, or read size/mime type e.t.c.
The manager provides solution that may help to handle and resolve this situations.

Some of the possible situations:
- file attribute is empty in database (file was never uploaded)
- formatted file has not been generated yet
- formatted file cannot be generated
- file attribute kept in database is invalid (the wrong path)

Each context may have one or more `file_not_found_handlers`.
When any file was not found, these handlers will be executed one by one,
until one of them will not resolve the situation.
If no one handler was not resolve it then exception fill be thrown.

Configure handlers
------------------

For configuring which formats your context have, you should change `file_not_found_handlers` setting.

This setting should be an array.
You may define handlers in two ways:
- without key, string value is the name of handler class
- without key, array value with `class` key is handler config
- key is the name of handler class, value is handler config

See examples below:

```php
use Bicycle\FilesManager\Context\FileNotFound;

return [
    // ...
    'file_not_found_handlers' => [

        FileNotFound\GenerateOnFlyHandler::class,

        [
            'class' => FileNotFound\LogExceptionHandler::class,
            'level' => 'warning',
        ],

        FileNotFound\ReturnUrlHandler::class => [
            'origin' => '/images/path/to/origin/no-photo.jpg',
            'formats' => [
                'thumb' => '/images/path/to/thumb/formatted/no-photo.jpg',
                'mini' => 'http://domain.com/some/url/to/no-photo.png',
            ],
            'default' => '/images/path/to/default/no-photo.gif',
        ],

    ],
    // ...
];
```

Handlers will be executed exactly in the same order as they defined below.

Common Settings
---------------

Almost all handlers has a set of identic settings.
To avoid writing docs about them in each of handler,
these settings will be described in this section.

*Specifying storages*

You may specify in which storage(s) the handler should or should not be processed.
See examples below:

```php
'file_not_found_handlers' => [
    // ...
    [
        'class' => 'Some\Handler\ClassName',
        'only_storages' => 'main',
        'only_storages' => ['main'],
        'except_storages' => 'temp',
        'except_storages' => ['temp'],
    ],
    // ...
],
```

*Specifying formats*

You may specify for which format(s) the handler should or should not be processed.
See examples below:


```php
'file_not_found_handlers' => [
    // ...
    [
        'class' => 'Some\Handler\ClassName',
        'only_formats' => 'format-name',
        'only_formats' => ['format1', 'format2'],
        'except_formats' => 'format-name',
        'except_formats' => ['format1', 'format2'],
    ],
    // ...
],
```

Handlers
========

Generate on Fly Handler
-----------------------

Handler `Bicycle\FilesManger\Context\FileNotFound\GenerateOnFlyHandler`
works only when formatted version of file was not found.

It tries to generate missed file on fly.
If file has been successfully generated, handlers process will be stopped,
generated file will be used for further processing.
If file has not been generated, handlers process will be continued by the next handler.

The full list of available settings and its defaults you may see below:

```php
GenerateOnFlyHandler::class => [
    'only_storages' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
    'except_storages' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
    'only_formats' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
    'except_formats' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
],
```

Return Url Handler
------------------

Handler `Bicycle\FilesManger\Context\FileNotFound\ReturnUrlHandler`
returns another urls, that was passed by its config.

- If there is origin file was not found, and `origin` setting is provided,
than the handler will return it.
- If there is formatted version of file was not found,
then the handler will search url among keys of `formats` array.
If value was found in `formats` then the handler will return it.
- Otherwise in both situations above, and if `default` setting is provided,
then the handler will return it.

The full list of available settings and its defaults you may see below:

```php
ReturnUrlHandler::class => [
    'origin' => null, // null or string
    'formats' => [
        // 'format-name' => '/url/for/this/format.ext',
    ],
    'default' => null, // null or string

    // The handler will not work if requested file exists.
    // It may be e.g. when file exists but by some reasons it cannot be read.
    // Default is true, because it is not good practice to mute the same situations.
    'skip_when_requested_exists' => true,

    'only_storages' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
    'except_storages' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
],
```

There is limitation exists on your urls in `origin`, `formats` and `default` settings.
It must be a relative url in your public directory or an absolute url to resource by HTTP(s) protocol.

Examples of allowed url formats:

```php
'/images/path/to/image.jpg', // the file must be in 'public' directory of your app
'http://domain.com/path/through/http/image.jpg',
'https://domain.com/path/through/https/image.jpg',
```

Log Exception Handler
---------------------

Handler `Bicycle\FilesManger\Context\FileNotFound\LogExceptionHandler` logs thrown exception.
It may be useful for using before another handler,
that return any predefined files, like [Return Url Handler](#return-url-handler),
so exception will be logged.

It logs exception using [Laravel's logging component](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/errors#logging).
You also may specify `level`, default is `error`.

After logging, handlers process will be continued by the next handler.

The full list of available settings and its defaults you may see below:

```php
LogExceptionHandler::class => [
    'level' => 'error',
    'log_previous' => true, // whether previous exception (if exists) must be also logged
    'only_storages' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
    'except_storages' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
    'only_formats' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
    'except_formats' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
],
```

Return Another Format Handler
-----------------------------

Handler `Bicycle\FilesManger\Context\FileNotFound\ReturnAnotherFormatHandler`
works only when formatted version of file was not found.

The handler returns origin or another formatted version of file.

The full list of available settings and its defaults you may see below:

```php
ReturnAnotherFormatHandler::class => [
    'return_format' => null, // string (the name of format), or null which means origin file

    // If true, then the handler returns formatted file only if it is exist.
    // If false and formatted file is not exist,
    // then likely the same `file_not_found_handlers` process will be started for it.
    'only_if_exists' => false,

    // The handler will not work if requested file exists.
    // It may be e.g. when file exists but by some reasons it cannot be read.
    // Default is true, because it is not good practice to mute the same situations.
    'skip_when_requested_exists' => true,

    'only_storages' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
    'except_storages' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
    'only_formats' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
    'except_formats' => null, // may be either null (default), or string, or array
],
```

Custom Handler
==============

You may write your own handlers.
For it you need to create your handler class and add
`Bicycle\FilesManager\Contracts\FileNotFoundHandler` interface in `implements` section.

The instance of your handler class will be resolved by laravel's container,
so you may inject here any needed services and objects.

The specified interface requires you to implement only one method:

```php
public function handle(\Bicycle\FilesManager\Contracts\FileNotFoundException $exception);
```

This method should resolve `$exception`.
You may use any method provided by this exception:

```php
$exception->getStorage(); // returns Storage in which a file was not found
$exception->getRelativePath(); // returns relative origin path of file that was not found
$exception->getFormat(); // returns the name of non-founded format or null (if origin was not found)
$exception->isOriginFileExists(); // whether origin file exists
$exception->isRequestedFileExists(); // whether requested version (formatted or origin) of file exists
```

The `$exception` is an instance of `Exception`,
so you may also use standard PHP Exception's methods.

The method must return one of the following results:

- instance of `\Bicycle\FilesManager\Contracts\FileSource`: handlers process will be stopped,
    this file source (just with `$format === null`) will be used to get value.
- `true`: handlers process will be stopped, value from primary source will be taken again.
- `false`: handlers process will be stopped, it means value cannot be fetched, exception will be thrown.
- `null`: handlers process will be continued with the next handler.

To use this class simply specify it name as the config key or in `class` config property:

```php
    // ...
    'file_not_found_handlers' => [
        // ...

        'Custom\Handler\ClassName\Example1' => [
            'property1' => 'value1',
            'property2' => 'value2',
        ],

        'Custom\Handler\ClassName\Example2',

        [
            'class' => 'Custom\Handler\ClassName\Example3',
            'property1' => 'value1',
            'property2' => 'value2',
        ],

        // ...
    ],
    // ...
```
