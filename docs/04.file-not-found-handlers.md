Introduction
============

Sometimes there may be situations when any file was not found,
and context cannot generate url, or read size/mime type e.t.c.
The manager provides solution that may help to handle and resolve this situations.

Some of the possible situations:
- file attribute is empty in database (file was never uploaded)
- formatted file has not been generated yet
- formatted file cannot be generated
- file attribute kept in database is invalid (the wrong path)

Each context may have one or more `file_not_found_handlers`.
When any file was not found, these handlers will be executed one by one,
until one of them will not resolve the situation.
If no one handler was not resolve it then exception fill be thrown.
