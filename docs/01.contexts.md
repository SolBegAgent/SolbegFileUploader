Introduction
============

All files in this plugin are separated by contexts.
For example: you probably want to have `product-logo` and `user-avatar` contexts,
so each of them have own custom config (validation, formatters and others).

Context types
-------------

To prevent code duplicate you may separate your contexts by types.
For example, you probably have models where need to upload images,
and have models where need to upload PDF files.

All images contexts likely have some similar configs.
E.g. allow only jpg, png and gif extensions, and image/* mime type.
And PDF contexts likely have own some similar configs that differs from image contexts.

So you may define `image` and `pdf` types in you files manager.
Configure them as you want.
And then only set ```php 'type' => 'image' ``` in your context's configuration file.

Example:

```php
    // in 'config/filemanager.php':
    'types' => [
        'default' => [
        ],

        'image' => [
            'validate' => [
                'types' => 'image/*',
                'extensions' => implode(', ', [
                    'jpg',
                    'jpeg',
                    'png',
                ]),
            ],
        ],

        'pdf' => [
            'validate' => [
                'types' => 'application/pdf',
                'extensions' => 'pdf',
            ],
        ],
    ],

    // in 'config/filecontexts/{context-name}.php'
    return [
        'type' => 'image',
    ];
```

But even so you can override any setting in concrete context.

```php
    // in 'config/filecontexts/{context-name}.php'
    return [
        'type' => 'image',
        'validate' => [
            // There is 'types' validator will be taken from `image` type config
            // But 'extensions' validator will be overrided so context will allow only files with 'png' extension.
            'extensions' => 'png',
        ],
    ];
```

By default `default` type used for contexts.
You may change this behaviour by changing `default_type` setting in `config/filemanager.php` file.

Global contexts config
----------------------

Sometime you probably want to set any global settings for all contexts.
You may do this by changing `global` setting in `config/filemanager.php` file.

For example, limit max size of uploaded files for all contexts to 50 mebibytes:

```php
    // in 'config/filemanager.php':
    'global' => [
        'validate' => [
            'size' => '50M',
        ],
    ],
```

But this global settings may be overrode for any context type or any concrete context.
